## How To Install Python ?

If you are working in Unix or Linux, you don’t need to install Python. This is because in Unix and Linux systems, Python is generally 
pre-installed. However, if you work in Windows or Mac then you need to download Python.

While there are several ways to install Python, one popular option is to use **Anaconda**. Anaconda is a distribution of Python that comes with many pre-installed libraries and tools, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.

In this section, we'll walk you through the steps to install Anaconda on your computer. We'll assume that you're using a Windows operating system, but the process should be similar for other operating systems. So, let's get started!

:::tip Points to be noted to avoid any confusion: 

- In Python, statements do not end with any special characters. Pythonconsiders the newline character as an indication of the fact that the statement has ended. If a statement is to span more than a single line, the next line must be preceded with a** (\ ) **.
- In Python, indentation is used to detect the presence of loops. The loops in Python do not began or end with delimiters or keywords.
- A file in Python is generally saved with a **.py** extension.
- The shell can be used as a handy calculator.
- The type of a variable need not to be mentioned in a program.
